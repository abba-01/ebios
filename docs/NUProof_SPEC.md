# NUProof Specification

**Layer 2 of eBIOS: Formal Verification Framework**

## Overview

NUProof is the formal verification layer of eBIOS, providing mathematical proofs that NUCore operations satisfy their claimed properties. It uses the Lean 4 theorem prover to create machine-checkable proofs with cryptographic attestation.

> "Verification is not a bureaucratic act — it is the ceremony that proves the system's integrity. eBIOS does not request trust; it performs it."

## Purpose

NUProof ensures that:
1. **Mathematical Correctness**: All NUCore operations satisfy formal specifications
2. **Invariant Preservation**: Key properties (non-negativity, enclosure, etc.) are proven
3. **Computational Integrity**: Proof hashes are cryptographically signed for attestation
4. **Trust Minimization**: Anyone can verify proofs locally without trusting external parties

## Architecture

|-------|-------------|
| **Layer 0 (eBIOS)** | Proof hashes signed with Layer 0 keypair |
| **Layer 1 (NUCore)** | Operations proven correct |
| **Layer 3 (NULedger)** | Proof hashes logged in Merkle chain |
| **Layer 7 (Certification)** | Proof status included in compliance reports |

## Formal Theorems

### 1. Non-Negativity

**File**: `NonNegativity.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
theorem all_operations_nonneg :
  (∀ p₁ p₂ : NUPair, 0 ≤ (add p₁ p₂).u) ∧
  (∀ p₁ p₂ : NUPair, 0 ≤ (multiply p₁ p₂).u) ∧
  (∀ p₁ p₂ : NUPair, ∀ h, 0 ≤ (compose p₁ p₂ h).u) ∧
  (∀ p : NUPair, 0 ≤ (flip p).u)
```

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Meaning**: Uncertainty is always non-negative across all operations.

**Proof Strategy**: Proven by construction using `Real.sqrt_nonneg`.

---

### 2. Enclosure Preservation

**File**: `Enclosure.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
theorem add_enclosure (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) :
  interval_add (toInterval p₁) (toInterval p₂) ⊆ toInterval (add p₁ p₂)

theorem multiply_enclosure (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) :
  interval_mul (toInterval p₁) (toInterval p₂) ⊆ toInterval (multiply p₁ p₂)
```

**Status**: ⏳ Skeleton (requires interval arithmetic lemmas)

**Meaning**: Output intervals always contain the exact result for any inputs within input intervals.

**Proof Strategy**: Direct interval arithmetic showing conservative bounds.

---

### 3. Addition Properties

**File**: `AddProperties.lean`

**Theorems**:
```lean
-- Commutativity
theorem add_comm (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) :
  add p₁ p₂ = add p₂ p₁

-- Associativity
theorem add_assoc (p₁ p₂ p₃ : NUPair) :
  add (add p₁ p₂) p₃ = add p₁ (add p₂ p₃)
```

**Status**: ✅ Commutativity complete, ⏳ Associativity skeleton

**Meaning**: Addition behaves as expected algebraically.

**Proof Strategy**: Commutativity follows from arithmetic. Associativity requires sqrt algebra lemmas.

---

### 4. Flip Involution

**File**: `FlipInvolutive.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
theorem flip_involutive (p : NUPair) :
  flip (flip p) = p
```

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Meaning**: Flipping twice returns the original value.

**Proof Strategy**: Direct by definition: `-(-n) = n`.

---

### 5. Composition Reduction

**File**: `ComposeReduction.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
theorem compose_reduces_uncertainty (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) (h : p₁.u ≠ 0 ∨ p₂.u ≠ 0) :
  (compose p₁ p₂ h).u ≤ min_real p₁.u p₂.u
```

**Status**: ⏳ Skeleton (requires algebraic manipulation)

**Meaning**: Combining evidence always reduces uncertainty.

**Proof Strategy**: Algebraic proof that `√[(u₁²·u₂²)/(u₁² + u₂²)] ≤ min(u₁, u₂)`.

---

### 6. Constant-Time Complexity

**File**: `Complexity.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
axiom operations_constant_time :
  ∃ (C : ℕ),
    (∀ p₁ p₂ : NUPair, True) ∧
    C > 0
```

**Status**: ⏳ Skeleton (meta-theorem about computational model)

**Meaning**: All operations execute in O(1) time independent of input magnitude.

**Proof Strategy**: By inspection - no recursion, loops, or variable allocation.

---

### 7. Monotonicity

**File**: `Monotonicity.lean`

**Theorem**:
```lean
theorem add_monotonic (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) :
  (add p₁ p₂).u ≥ max_real p₁.u p₂.u
```

**Status**: ⏳ Skeleton (requires inequality lemmas)

**Meaning**: Operations preserve or increase uncertainty (except compose).

**Proof Strategy**: `√(u₁² + u₂²) ≥ max(u₁, u₂)` by Pythagorean property.

## Proof Workflow

### 1. Define Operation in Lean

```lean
def add (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) : NUPair where
  n := p₁.n + p₂.n
  u := Real.sqrt (p₁.u^2 + p₂.u^2)
  h_nonneg := by apply Real.sqrt_nonneg
```

### 2. State Theorem

```lean
theorem add_nonneg (p₁ p₂ : NUPair) :
  0 ≤ (add p₁ p₂).u := by
  exact (add p₁ p₂).h_nonneg
```

### 3. Verify Locally

```bash
cd verification/NUProof
lean AddProperties.lean  # Check syntax and type-check
lake build               # Build entire project
```

### 4. Generate Cryptographic Hash

```bash
python3 generate_proof_hashes.py
```

Output (`proof_manifest.json`):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T05:28:00Z",
  "ebios_layer": 2,
  "component": "NUProof",
  "proofs": [
    {
      "filename": "NonNegativity.lean",
      "sha256": "a7f3c8d9e1b4f2a6...",
      "signature": "ed25519:e4b2f1a8c3d7...",
      "status": "complete"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. CI Verification

GitHub Actions automatically:
- Builds all proofs on commit
- Checks that "complete" proofs don't contain `sorry`
- Generates and uploads proof manifest
- Validates proof-code correspondence

## Cryptographic Attestation

### Proof Hash Chain

Each proof file generates:
1. **SHA-256 hash** of the `.lean` file
2. **Ed25519 signature** using eBIOS Layer 0 keypair
3. **Status tag**: `complete` or `skeleton`

This creates an immutable record:
- You can verify the proofs yourself (Lean kernel)
- You can verify the hashes match (SHA-256)
- You can verify the signatures (Ed25519 public key)

### Attestation Format

```json
{
  "filename": "NonNegativity.lean",
  "sha256": "a7f3c8d9...",
  "signature": "ed25519:e4b2f1a8...",
  "status": "complete"
}
```

This attestation is:
- **Timestamped**: When the proof was verified
- **Signed**: By eBIOS Layer 0 keypair
- **Auditable**: Logged in NULedger (Layer 3)
- **Portable**: Can be independently verified

## Verification Without Trust

Anyone can verify NUProof attestations:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/abba-01/ebios.git
cd ebios/verification/NUProof

# 2. Install Lean 4
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# 3. Verify proofs
lake build

# 4. Check hashes
python3 generate_proof_hashes.py
diff proof_manifest.json <downloaded_manifest>

# 5. Verify signatures (requires public key)
python3 verify_signatures.py --pubkey ebios_layer0.pub
```

No trust required — only:
- Lean kernel (open-source, peer-reviewed)
- SHA-256 (NIST standard)
- Ed25519 (well-studied cryptography)

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/verify-proofs.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main`, `master`, or `phase*` branches
- Pull requests modifying proofs or NUCore
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs**:
1. **verify-lean-proofs**
   - Install Lean 4
   - Build all proofs
   - Check for `sorry` in complete proofs
   - Generate proof hashes
   - Upload manifest artifact

2. **verify-python-tests**
   - Run NUCore Python tests
   - Check coverage ≥ 90%
   - Validate test results

3. **integration-check**
   - Verify proof-code correspondence
   - Check all operations have proofs
   - Final validation report

### Failure Conditions

CI fails if:
- Any Lean proof doesn't type-check
- Complete proof contains `sorry` or `axiom`
- Python test coverage < 90%
- Operation in code lacks corresponding proof

## Development Roadmap

### PHASE 2 (Current)
- ✅ Create Lean proof skeletons
- ✅ Implement proof hash generation
- ✅ Set up CI pipeline
- ⏳ Complete enclosure proofs
- ⏳ Complete associativity proof

### PHASE 3+
- Complete all skeleton proofs
- Add Coq alternative implementations
- Formal proof of Python-Lean correspondence
- Hardware attestation integration (TPM)

## Philosophy

### Verification as Ceremony

> "Verification is not a bureaucratic act — it is the ceremony that proves the system's integrity."

Formal proofs are not "nice to have" — they are the **foundation of trust**. eBIOS doesn't ask you to trust the developers; it gives you mathematical proof.

### Truth as Data Structure

Every proof is:
- **Formal**: Written in type theory
- **Checkable**: Verifiable by anyone with Lean
- **Attested**: Cryptographically signed
- **Immutable**: Merkle-chained in NULedger

> "Truth is a data structure, not a declaration."

### Local Verification, Global Trust

You can verify proofs locally:
- No network required
- No trusted third party
- Just you, Lean, and math

This is the essence of eBIOS Layer 2:

> "Verification is local; trust is global. eBIOS is the common denominator for honesty."
