## Verification Task

**Component**: [e.g., NUCore, NULedger, NUGuard]

**Operation/Function**: [e.g., NUCore.multiply, NULedger.append]

**Property to Prove**: [e.g., Associativity, Non-negativity, Constant-time execution]

**Theorem Statement**:
```
[Mathematical statement of the theorem]
Example: ∀ (n1,u1), (n2,u2): u1 ≥ 0 ∧ u2 ≥ 0 → u_out ≥ 0
```

## Requirements

- [ ] Formal proof implemented (Coq/Lean/other)
- [ ] Proof validated by automated theorem prover
- [ ] Proof hash generated and recorded
- [ ] Integration test validating property with test cases
- [ ] Documentation updated in `/docs/`
- [ ] CI pipeline validates proof on build

## Proof Location

**File**: `/verification/NUProof/[filename].v` or `.lean`

## Related Operations

[List any related operations or dependencies]

## References

[Academic papers, prior theorems, or documentation references]

**Verification Principle**: *Truth is a data structure, not a declaration.*
