## Core Component Update

**Component**: [e.g., eBIOS, NUCore, NUProof, NULedger]

**Layer**: [0-8]

**Type**: [Enhancement / Bug Fix / Optimization]

## Description

[Clear description of the proposed change and why it's needed]

## Motivation

[Explain the problem being solved or capability being added]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level description of how this will be implemented]

## Immutability Checklist

- [ ] **No mutable state introduced** — All state changes are append-only
- [ ] **Determinism preserved** — Identical inputs produce identical outputs
- [ ] **Attestation maintained** — All operations generate signed attestations
- [ ] **Audit trail complete** — No operations obscure or delete logs
- [ ] **O(1) complexity** — Core operations maintain constant-time guarantees (if applicable)
- [ ] **No runtime configuration** — Behavior is compile-time fixed

## Formal Proofs Required

List theorems that must be proven for this change:

- [ ] [Theorem 1: e.g., Non-negativity preservation]
- [ ] [Theorem 2: e.g., Enclosure property maintained]
- [ ] [Theorem 3: e.g., Signature chain integrity]

## Testing Plan

- [ ] Unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests validating invariants
- [ ] Formal verification tests (Coq/Lean)
- [ ] Attestation validation tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (if applicable)

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Updated specification in `/docs/`
- [ ] API documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Example usage code
- [ ] Migration guide (if breaking change)

## Affected Components

[List any other components affected by this change]

## Backward Compatibility

[Describe impact on existing systems]

- [ ] Fully backward compatible
- [ ] Requires migration (describe plan)
- [ ] Breaking change (justify why necessary)

## Security Considerations

[Describe any security implications, cryptographic changes, or attestation impacts]
