  # Constant-Time Complexity Theorem

  **Theorem**: ∀ OP ∈ {⊕, ⊗, ⊙, Flip}:
    Time(OP(n₁, u₁, n₂, u₂)) = O(1)
    Space(OP(n₁, u₁, n₂, u₂)) = O(1)

  **Proof Strategy**:
  By inspection of implementation:
  1. Each operation performs fixed arithmetic operations
  2. No loops, recursion, or variable allocation
  3. All operations use primitive float arithmetic (O(1))

  **Note**: This is a meta-theorem about the computational model.
  Lean proof focuses on showing no unbounded structures are created.

  **Status**: Skeleton (requires computational complexity framework)

  Meta-theorem: Operations have bounded computational steps

  This is proven by structural inspection:
  - add: 2 additions, 2 squarings, 1 addition, 1 sqrt = 6 ops
  - multiply: 3 multiplications, 3 squarings, 2 additions, 1 sqrt = 9 ops
  - compose: 4 multiplications, 4 squarings, 2 additions, 2 divisions, 1 sqrt = 13 ops
  - flip: 1 negation = 1 op

  All are constant (independent of input magnitude or graph depth).
