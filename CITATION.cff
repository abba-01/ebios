abstract: >
  eBIOS (Epistemic Basic Input/Output System) is a foundational firmware layer
  for uncertainty-aware computation in safety-critical systems. Like a traditional
  BIOS provides hardware initialization and I/O primitives, eBIOS provides
  epistemic primitives for uncertainty quantification, formal verification, and
  accountability. It implements N/U (Nominal/Uncertainty) Algebra with formal
  verification in Lean 4, cryptographic audit trails, and policy-driven runtime
  monitoring. The system enforces three immutable principles: truth is a data
  structure (immutability), failure is allowed but lying is not (provability),
  and you can run what you want but you can't hide what you did (accountability).
  This alpha release includes 62.5% formal proof completion with rigorous
  interval arithmetic and uncertainty reduction theorems.
