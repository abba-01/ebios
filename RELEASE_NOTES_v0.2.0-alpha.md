# eBIOS v0.2.0-alpha - Formal Verification Milestone

**DOI**: (Will be assigned by Zenodo automatically)

## Summary

This alpha release marks significant progress on formal verification for **eBIOS** (**Epistemic Basic Input/Output System**) - a foundational firmware layer for uncertainty-aware computation in safety-critical systems.

## Formal Verification Progress

**Completion**: 62.5% (5/8 proofs complete)

### New Proofs (This Release)
- ✅ **Enclosure.lean** (278 lines) - Proves interval arithmetic enclosure with conservative √2 and √3 factors
- ✅ **ComposeReduction.lean** (125 lines) - Proves uncertainty reduction through evidence composition

### Previously Complete
- ✅ **NonNegativity.lean** - Proves u ≥ 0 invariant
- ✅ **FlipInvolutive.lean** - Proves flip² = identity
- ✅ **NUCore.lean** - Core definitions

### Total Formal Verification
- **403 lines** of rigorous Lean 4 proof code
- Zero `sorry` statements in completed proofs
- All proofs type-check and compile

## Core Features (v0.1.0 Base)

### Layer 1: NUCore

- O(1) constant-time execution
- 39/39 tests passing

### Layer 3: NULedger
- Cryptographic audit ledger with Ed25519 signatures
- Merkle tree for O(log n) verification
- 38/38 tests passing

### Layer 4: NUGuard
- Runtime monitoring with configurable rules
- Event-driven architecture
- 32/32 tests passing

### Layer 5: NUPolicy
- Policy management with cryptographic signing
- JSON-based configuration

- 13 endpoints for governance
- 22/22 tests passing

## Quality Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 100% (172/172 tests passing)
- **Documentation**: Complete (9 specifications, 4,631 lines)
- **Formal Verification**: 62.5% (5/8 proofs complete)
- **Code Quality**: Zero known bugs

## Philosophy

**eBIOS** is an **Epistemic BIOS** - like a traditional BIOS provides hardware initialization and I/O primitives, eBIOS provides epistemic primitives for uncertainty quantification.

The system enforces three immutable principles:

1. **Immutability**: Truth is a data structure, not a declaration
2. **Provability**: Failure is allowed. Lying about failure is not.
3. **Accountability**: You can run what you want above it, but you can't hide what you did

## Use Cases

- Safety-critical systems (automotive, aerospace)
- Medical device firmware
- Sensor fusion with uncertainty tracking
- Distributed consensus with epistemic guarantees
- Government and institutional applications requiring auditability

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abba-01/ebios.git
cd ebios
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/  # All 172 tests should pass
